        At GDG on Campus ITER, we are more than just a community — we are a
        movement of dreamers, builders, and innovators. Powered by Google
        Developers, we stand at the intersection of ideas and impact, bringing
        together students, developers, and creators who dare to think beyond the
        ordinary.

      <p className=" text-lg leading-relaxed">
        We believe in learning by doing, growing by sharing, and leading by
        inspiring. From classrooms to hackathons, from meetups to mega events —
        we transform curiosity into creation and passion into progress.
